## My process

- Plan HTML and CSS on paper to consider how to approach the challenge.
- Build out semantic HTML.
- Add styles, working from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- ems for padding, margin etc. 
- Rems for fonts.

### Continued development

- I used a flexbox on <main> where really I should have been able to center the container using margin alone, but something was changing the block property of it which I couldn't pin point. Want to keep code as simple as possible to improve readability and scalability, so need to continue working with fundamentals as much as I can.
